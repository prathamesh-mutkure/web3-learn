# Learn Web3, Solidity, Smart Contracts, DApps and more!

Want to get started with Web3 Development? Hello I'm [Prathamesh](https://www.prathamesh.co/), I'm documenting my journey from a web2 to web3 developer through this repository, I'll be posting all the updates on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Prathamesh_M009), make sure to follow me to learn from my journey, I'll be happy to connect with you through Twitter DM :)

This repo currently contains code related to -

- Solidity
- Smart Contracts

I'll soon be adding more web3 projects related to Go Ethereum, Truffle, NFTs, DApps and much more exciting stuff, turn on notification for this repo to get a notification each time I add something interesting!

# Installation

To view this code on your local machine, Install [VSCode]() and [solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) extension (You can install any other IDE of your choice, but VSCode is recommended for quick setup)

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prathamesh-mutkure/web3-learn.git
```

Open the cloned repository in VSCode and run following commands

```sh
npm install -g @remix-project/remixd
remixd -s .
```

Then go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is an browser based IDE for Solidity, it will manage all the dependancies and deployment of our Smart Contracts

On the left menu, click on `default_workspace` and select connect to `localhost`, and click connect button on the popup and give neccessary permissions if asked, Remix should be able to load all the files in a few seconds

Then finally open the smart contract code you want to deploy, go to compiler menu on the left and select appropriate solidity version, once the code gets successfully compiled, go to the deployment menu and deploy the Smart Contract

Congratulations on successfully setting up your enviornment locally ðŸ¥³
